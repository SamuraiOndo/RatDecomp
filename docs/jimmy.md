# Jimmy Folder
The "Jimmy" folder includes leftover assets from Kalisto's "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius" game. These are for a much earlier version of the engine, so only uses these for reference and naming schemes, as they tend to share a lot of similarities.

This includes:
* DWARF info (struct/class variable names, local variable names)
* Enums and headers for ABC_Agent related code.
